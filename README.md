# TheUnfinishedSwanInternal
A very little internal cheat which allows for autowalk, fly and coordinate displaying.
It uses the ftxui library to turn the cmd into something more beautiful!  
Inject after having fully loaded ingame. Use any injector of your choice (the game does not contain an AC).  
I used ProcessHacker :)
### Enjoy exploring the world of The Unfinished Swan!
